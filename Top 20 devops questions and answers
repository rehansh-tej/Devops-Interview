Harness CI/CD and Pipeline Management

1. Scenario: Blue-Green Deployment with Harness

Question: Your company wants to implement a Blue-Green deployment strategy using Harness for a critical .NET application. How would you achieve this?

Answer:
I would set up two identical environments (Blue and Green) in Harness. The process involves:

Step 1: Create separate pipelines for deployment to Blue and Green environments.

Step 2: Route incoming traffic using a load balancer (AWS ALB or F5) and configure it to point to the active environment.

Step 3: Deploy the new version to the inactive environment (Green).

Step 4: Run tests and verify health using Harness verification steps and SonarQube integration for quality checks.

Step 5: Switch traffic from Blue to Green by updating DNS or ALB target groups.

Step 6: Rollback using traffic switch if issues arise.


Real-time Example:
In a financial services company, this strategy reduced deployment failures by 60% by allowing immediate rollbacks without downtime.

2. Scenario: Canary Deployment for a Java Application

Question: How would you implement a Canary deployment for a Java microservice using Harness?

Answer:

Step 1: Configure Harness Canary Workflow with two deployment phases (e.g., 10% and 90%).

Step 2: Deploy the first phase (10%) and monitor key metrics using Datadog and ELK.

Step 3: If no errors, proceed with the remaining 90% deployment.

Step 4: Use JFrog Artifactory for storing artifacts and SonarQube for code quality gating.


Real-time Example:
A retail company used this approach to deploy feature updates gradually to avoid breaking production, improving stability by 35%.

3. Scenario: Migrating Jenkins Pipelines to Harness

Question: How would you migrate existing Jenkins pipelines to Harness?

Answer:

Step 1: Analyze existing Jenkins pipelines and convert them into Harness YAML-based pipelines.

Step 2: Integrate Harness with version control (GitHub) and artifact repositories (JFrog).

Step 3: Replace Jenkins scripts with Harness steps, ensuring feature parity.

Step 4: Test the new Harness pipeline in a staging environment before production deployment.


Real-time Example:
An enterprise moved from Jenkins to Harness, reducing pipeline execution time by 40% through optimized parallel execution.

Cloud and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

4. Scenario: AWS Multi-Account Terraform Provisioning

Question: You need to provision AWS infrastructure across multiple accounts using Terraform. How would you do it?

Answer:

Step 1: Use Terraform workspaces to manage different AWS accounts.

Step 2: Configure AWS provider blocks dynamically using variables and profiles.

Step 3: Store state files securely in AWS S3 with DynamoDB locking for concurrency control.

Step 4: Implement Terraform modules to standardize infrastructure across accounts.


Real-time Example:
A healthcare provider used this strategy to manage infrastructure in development, staging, and production, reducing manual efforts by 50%.

5. Scenario: Enforcing Security Policies in Terraform

Question: How would you ensure security compliance when provisioning infrastructure using Terraform?

Answer:

Step 1: Use Terraform Sentinel or Open Policy Agent (OPA) to enforce security rules.

Step 2: Implement IAM least privilege policies.

Step 3: Scan Terraform code with Checkmarx or tfsec before applying changes.


Real-time Example:
A fintech firm prevented security misconfigurations by integrating OPA with Terraform pipelines, blocking non-compliant resources.

CI/CD Security and Governance

6. Scenario: Implementing RBAC in Harness

Question: How would you configure RBAC in Harness for a team with different access levels?

Answer:

Step 1: Define roles in Harness with permissions for deployment, approvals, and read-only access.

Step 2: Use LDAP integration to sync user roles.

Step 3: Assign roles at the project, environment, or pipeline level.


Real-time Example:
A large organization used RBAC to prevent unauthorized production deployments, reducing misconfigurations by 80%.


---

7. Scenario: Secure Artifact Storage

Question: How would you secure artifact storage in JFrog Artifactory within a CI/CD pipeline?

Answer:

Step 1: Enable fine-grained access controls and token-based authentication.

Step 2: Implement checksum validation to prevent tampering.

Step 3: Regularly scan stored artifacts using Xray for vulnerabilities.


Real-time Example:
A DevOps team identified and blocked vulnerable dependencies before deployment, preventing security breaches.


---

Monitoring and Observability

8. Scenario: Monitoring CI/CD Pipeline Failures

Question: How would you monitor and analyze CI/CD pipeline failures in Harness?

Answer:

Step 1: Integrate Harness with ELK and Datadog for centralized logging.

Step 2: Set up alerts for failed pipeline stages.

Step 3: Use Harness failure strategies for automatic retries or rollbacks.


Real-time Example:
A SaaS company reduced deployment failures by 45% by implementing automated rollback policies.


---

9. Scenario: Handling High Latency in Kubernetes Applications

Question: Your deployed microservices in EKS are experiencing high latency. How do you troubleshoot and optimize?

Answer:

Step 1: Use Prometheus and Grafana to analyze service response times.

Step 2: Optimize HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) settings.

Step 3: Tune network policies to reduce inter-service latency.


Real-time Example:
An e-commerce company reduced checkout latency by 30% by optimizing pod scaling.
